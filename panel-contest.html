  The theme of the contest is <b>EDUCATION</b>. The theme is only meant to
  be a broad general guideline. Use your imagination to create your own
  unique app in this broad category - you could build a handwriting tutor,
  a math puzzle, a fractal explorer, a todo/time management app or any
  other idea that you can fit into the theme!
</p>

<p><b>Don't forget to look at the Rules section below.</b></p>

<h2>The Goal</h2>

The goal is to show the world some of the great things that can be built
quickly with Kivy while having fun, and to give more people an
opportunity to try out Kivy's cool features. The general guidelines are:

<h2>The Rules</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Keep it family friendly.</li>
  <li>Make it fun and attractive, show how your Kivy app can stand out from the crowd.</li>
  <li>Entries can be from individuals or from teams.</li>
  <li>No prior code - build your full app during the competition month.
      You are allowed to reuse existing known open source libraries in conjunction with Kivy.</li>
  <li>Don't forget the theme: Education!</li>
  <li>Apps should be submitted by <b>23:59 GMT 14th May 2014</b> using a public url to a Git repo.
</ul>

<h2>Technical</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Entry point of the app should be main.py</li>
    <li>Mention setup instructions precisely in your README instructions.</li>
    <li>If you are using specific hardware dependent features, make sure to
        mention them too, so that we can test the app on its intended target.</li>
    <li>Entries would need to be submitted using a Git repository which
        will be pulled in on the completion date by an automated script.</li>
    <li>The state the entry gets pulled in at the end time would be counted as final.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best of luck and have fun!</h2>
